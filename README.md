# Why Elsie didn't want to sit next to Fred anymore
An [electricomics](http://electricomics.net/) experiment using residence time on current panel to determine the path to the next one. First in a series of experiments to get my head around the codebase before I try to introduce better support for different formal/navigational approaches.

## Structure
The story has branches in it - four of the panels on the "trunk" lead off to other folks' opinions of what went down between Fred and Elsie (which you can see in the trunk)

## How to read
- Tap on the right 2/3 of the screen to go forwards, left 1/3 to go back (standard electricomics interaction)
- To keep going forward along the trunk, you'll need to click onto the next panel within 2 seconds of the previous one - no dawdling, otherwise you get sent back to the start!
- If you reach a panel with a little pointy hand at the top, and stay there for more than 5 seconds, you'll unlock the branch coming off that panel, and get to read all about that (at your own pace - no weird time constraints once you're off the main line.

## Thoughts &amp; Reflections
The main purpose for building this was to tinker around with the electricomics code base. Early e-comics will resemble their physical brethren, much as early cinema resembled theatre - but I believe the big inovations in e-comics are going to lie in messing around with the form in ways that paper books generally can't. In the early days (i.e. now), that's going to fall to arthouse experimenters like me, but given a bit of time, these sort of techniques will find their way into the mainstream too.

The reader is hurried through the main story here - wait more than 2 seconds on any panel and you're booted back to the start. To get onto one of the branches, though, you have to be patient, and sit and look at the same panel for 5 whole seconds. Neither choice is designed to be comfortable, but to add a sense of urgency and impatience. Given the story poses a question that it never really answers, that seems kind of appropriate.

What other ways could we play with the fact that our e-comic has an in-built clock? Could a panel start to morph, or add extra layers, as time passes? What effect would that have on the reading experience?

Images used in this strip are repurposed from [the Exhibition "What Is Home?"](https://improvisedcomics.co.uk/category/what_is_home/), first shown at Kendal YWCA during the [Lakes International Comic Art Festival 2015](http://www.comicartfestival.com/), and returning in 2016 with a few new bells and whistles! All proceeds from the exhibition go to charity (Kendal YWCA).

## Technical Support
The only way to read this comic is to use the Electricomics reading apps. (If you choose to install it to read my comics, then thank you, I'm honoured - you'll also get to access a lot of other good free content. Look out for Tzvi Lebetkin & Lars Schwed Nygard & Torgeir Trapnes works, just to name two.)

### Desktop/Laptop computers
You can download a desktop electricomics reader app [right here](https://github.com/electricomics/web-reader/releases) - it'll work with Windows, Mac and Linux systems (i.e. pretty much any computer)

### Ipad
The ipad app can be found on the Apple app store

On either app, enter the following URL into the import feature
